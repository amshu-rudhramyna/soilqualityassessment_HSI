Here is the summary of our progress and the specific commands you need.

### **1. Project Summary**

We have successfully established the engineering backbone for your capstone: **"Soil Quality Assessment using Hyperspectral Imaging."**

**A. Technical Infrastructure**

* **Environment:** Created a conflict-free Python environment (`hypersoil`) on your Windows PC.
* **Hardware Acceleration:** Successfully linked PyTorch and XGBoost to your **RTX 3070 GPU** (CUDA 12.1).
* **Tools:** Configured VS Code with specialized geospatial libraries (`rasterio`, `spectral`, `eotdl`) that usually fail on Windows.

**B. Code Pipeline (Completed)**
We implemented a robust "Sim-to-Real" pipeline that mimics the research paper's methodology:

* **`generate_mock_data.py`:** A script to create synthetic hyperspectral cubes (150 bands, 11x11 pixels) to prove the system works despite server outages.
* **`baseline_model.py`:** The main engine that:
1. Loads `.npz` data.
2. Preprocesses signals (Savitzky-Golay smoothing).
3. Trains a Random Forest Regressor.
4. Outputs an  accuracy score and saves the model (`.pkl`).



**C. Current Data Status**

* **Real Data:** The EOTDL server is currently returning `404/403` errors (permission locks).
* **Solution:** We used **Mock Data** to pass your university review. The code is ready to swap in the real files the moment access is granted.

### **2. Visualization of Work**

**Comparison: Mock vs. Real Data Strategy**
| Feature | **Current Mock Data** (Used for Review) | **Real Hyperview-2 Data** (Goal) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Source** | Generated by `numpy` (Synthetic) | Satellite/Airborne Sensors (EOTDL) |
| **Shape** | `(200, 150, 11, 11)` | `(1800+, 150, H, W)` |
| **Nutrients** | P, K, Mg, pH (Mathematically correlated) | P, K, Mg, pH (Lab measured) |
| **Purpose** | To verify code logic & pipeline flow | To train the final high-accuracy model |

### **3. The Prompt/Command to Fetch Data**

Since "Gemini CLI" cannot download files directly (it generates code), you likely need the **Terminal Command** to run on your machine once permissions are fixed.

#### **Option A: The Terminal Command (If using EOTDL CLI)**

Use this in your VS Code terminal (Powershell). *Note: This requires you to have clicked "Join" on the AI4EO website first.*

```powershell
eotdl datasets get HYPERVIEW2 -v 2 --assets --path dataset --force
